# Design Principles to Govern Electrode Fabrication for the Lithium Trivanadate Cathode
Simulation results and code used for analysis and interactive plotting. Accompanies paper found at: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ab91c8

**Important:** As of right now, these installation instructions work for those using a Mac/Linux. However, if you have jupyter notebooks set up on your Windows system, you can install the necessary packages in requirements.txt and open the notebook Design Principles to Govern Electrode Fabrication for the Lithium Trivanadate Cathode [Accompanying Code].ipynb in this repository. 

To use the interactive tool, follow the instructions below:

1) Make sure python3 is installed. The below command should work.

<code>python3 --version</code>

2) Clone this repository. Either download it from github, or type the following into your terminal:
 
<code>git clone https://github.com/karthikmayil/LVO-Electrode-Design</code>

Change into this directory:

<code>cd LVO-Electrode-Design</code>

3) The following commands need only be done once in terminal. Note: The last step, which installs necessary packages, might take a bit longer than the first two which will be very quick.

<code>chmod +x install.sh</code>

<code>chmod +x run.sh</code>

<code>./install.sh</code>

4) Open the tool and interact! This same line can be executed to open the interactive tool again.

<code>./run.sh</code>
